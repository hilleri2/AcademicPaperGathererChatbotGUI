Abstract
Large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s 
Bard or Meta’s LLaMa, have created unprecedented opportunities for 
analysing and generating language data on a massive scale. Because 
language data have a central role in all areas of psychology, this new 
technology has the potential to transform the field. In this Perspective, 
we review the foundations of LLMs. We then explain how the way that 
LLMs are constructed enables them to effectively generate human-like 
linguistic output without the ability to think or feel like a human. We 
argue that although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological 
measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready 
for many of the most transformative psychological applications — 
but further research and development may enable such use. Next, 
we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to 
psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude 
with recommendations for investments that could help to address these 
concerns: field-initiated ‘keystone’ datasets; increased standardization 
of performance benchmarks; and shared computing and analysis 
infrastructure to ensure that the future of LLM-powered research is 
equitable.
